# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System

A **smart agriculture solution** that predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on soil, weather, and environmental conditions. This system uses **Machine Learning** to help farmers make data-driven decisions, increasing yield and sustainability.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Intelligent Crop Prediction:** Suggests crops based on soil parameters, rainfall, temperature, and humidity.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input form for environmental parameters.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented using **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, and **SVM** for accurate predictions.
* **Data Visualization:** Displays insights and patterns from agricultural datasets.
* **Responsive Design:** Can be accessed on desktop and mobile devices.

---

## 📊 Dataset

* Dataset contains environmental parameters like **Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity**, and corresponding crops.
* Data preprocessing includes **handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection**.
* Publicly available datasets from sources like **Kaggle** or **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

   * Cleaned dataset, handled missing values, encoded categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualized feature correlations, distribution, and insights.
3. **Model Building & Evaluation**

   * Trained multiple models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM.
   * Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Prediction Module**

   * Integrated trained model with frontend interface for live crop recommendations.
